# Image Uploader API

Image Uploader API is a project made with Express, as a solution to a dev challenge from [Dev Challenges](https://legacy.devchallenges.io/paths/full-stack-developer).

## Description

Image uploader is a website that allows you to upload images by selecting them on your computer, and after uploading you can copy the url to the clipboard. Built with ReactJs using NextJs, using Tailwind css for styling and ExpressJS for the backend.

## Installation 
You'll need NodeJs to be installed on your machine. Also, you need to clone the [frontend repository](https://github.com/andres326/image-uploader-client) to see how the client works. Clone the repository and install the dependencies using:  

```bash
npm install
```

After the installation, you can start running

```bash
npm run dev
```
